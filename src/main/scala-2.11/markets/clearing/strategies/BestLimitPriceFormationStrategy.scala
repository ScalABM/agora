    *
    * This matching engine uses the “Best limit” price improvement rule: if the opposite book
    * does have limit orders, then the trade settles at the better of two prices (either the
    * incoming order’s limit or the best limit from the opposite book) the term “better of two
    * prices” is from the point of view of the incoming limit order. In other words, if incoming
    * limit order would have crossed with outstanding opposite “best limit” order in the absence
    * of market order, then the trade would execute at that, potentially improved, “best limit”
    * price.
    *
    * @param incoming the incoming order.
    * @param existing the order that resides at the top of the opposite book.
    * @return the price at which the trade between the two orders will execute.
