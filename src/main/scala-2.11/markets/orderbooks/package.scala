/** Classes for modeling order books.
  *
  * =`OrderBook` API=
  * An order book has some underlying collection of orders.  These `existingOrders` should contain
  * either ask orders or bid orders for a specific `Tradable` (i.e., physical good or some promise
  * to deliver physical goods).
  *
  * - An `OrderBook` should be able to `add` and `remove` orders from `existingOrders` in constant
  * time (i.e., implementations of these methods should be `O(1)` operations).
  * - An `OrderBook` should be able to filter `existingOrders` and return only those orders that
  * satisfy some predicate. Use cases: Suppose a market participant wanted to chose from orders
  * that satisfied certain criteria? suppose market participant wanted to trade with a specific
  * counterparty?
  *
  * ==The `PriorityOrderBook` API==
  * A sorted order book maintains some underlying collection of `prioritisedOrders`. These
  * `prioritisedOrders` should contain either ask orders or bid orders for a specific `Tradable`.
  *
  * - Implementations of `add` and `remove` methods should be `O(log n)` operations.
  * - A `PriorityOrderBook` should be able to view the highest priority order as well as remove
  * and return the highest priority order. The view operation should be constant (i.e., `O(1)`)
  * time; removing the highest priority order should be `O(log n)` time.
  *
  * ==Thread safety==
  * Default implementations of `OrderBook` in the `markets-sandbox` are __not__ thread-safe and
  * are optimized for single-threaded performance. Check out implementations of order books
  * embedded in Akka actors in the `AkkABM` library for users interested in thread safe
  * implementations.
